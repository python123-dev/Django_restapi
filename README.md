rest_api using django generics

Django REST Framework (DRF) is a powerful and popular toolkit for building Web APIs in Django. 
It provides a set of tools and functionalities that make it easier to develop RESTful APIs, including request parsing, 
response serialization, authentication, permissions, and more.

Here are some key features and components of Django REST Framework:

Serialization: DRF provides a flexible serialization framework that allows you to easily convert Python objects into different data representations, 
such as JSON, XML, or YAML. It includes serializers that handle the conversion and validation of complex data types, including model instances.

Views: DRF offers various view classes, such as APIView, GenericAPIView, and ViewSet, which allow you to define the API behavior and handle different
HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, etc.) for your resources. These views provide a consistent and reusable way to define the API logic.

Authentication and Permissions: DRF provides built-in support for authentication mechanisms like token-based authentication, session authentication, and OAuth.
It also offers a flexible permission system to control access to API endpoints based on user roles and permissions.

URL Routing: DRF integrates with Django's URL routing system, allowing you to define URL patterns for your API endpoints using a similar syntax as Django's
urls.py file. You can use routers to automatically generate URL patterns for your views.

Pagination: DRF includes pagination classes to help manage large result sets returned by your APIs.
You can easily paginate the response data and provide links for navigation.

Filtering, Ordering, and Searching: DRF provides tools to enable filtering, ordering, and searching capabilities in your API views.
You can filter and order querysets based on query parameters, and perform full-text search operations on your data.

Authentication and API Throttling: DRF offers configurable rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to control the 
rate at which clients can make requests to your API.



Django REST Framework (DRF) provides a set of generic views that simplify the process of building API views with common functionality. 
These generic views are part of the generics module in DRF and offer pre-built functionality for common operations like retrieving, creating, updating,
and deleting resources.

Here are some of the commonly used generic views provided by DRF's generics module:

ListAPIView: This view provides a read-only endpoint that returns a list of resources. It corresponds to the HTTP GET method.

RetrieveAPIView: This view retrieves a single resource by its unique identifier. It corresponds to the HTTP GET method.

CreateAPIView: This view allows the creation of new resources. It corresponds to the HTTP POST method.

UpdateAPIView: This view allows updating an existing resource. It corresponds to the HTTP PUT method.

DestroyAPIView: This view allows deleting an existing resource. It corresponds to the HTTP DELETE method.

These generic views handle common tasks such as serializing/deserializing data, validating requests, handling permissions, 
and providing default implementations for common HTTP methods. They provide a clean and consistent way to define API views without repeating boilerplate code.

To use the generic views in your Django project, you typically define a serializer class for your model, then subclass the appropriate generic view and specify 
the model and serializer class.
